# Appendix F (Addendum) — Physical Basis for φ Bounds

We justify φ bounds from first-principles or standard platform theory.

**Dynamical decoupling (DD).** Filter-function theory yields decoherence ∝ ∫ S_β(ω) |F_N(ω)|^2 dω.
For 1/f^{γ} baths with 0.8≲γ≲1.2 and Carr–Purcell family sequences, the slope of log τ vs log N_DD
varies in the band 0.9–1.6 after accounting for pulse errors and finite bandwidth. We therefore set
φ_DD ∈ [0.9, 1.6].

**Si:P (spectral diffusion).** Central-spin models with hyperfine-limited diffusion imply τ ∝ p^{ζ}
with ζ in [0.8, 1.3] across the measured impurity ranges. Hence φ_Si:P ∈ [0.8, 1.3].

**Cat codes.** Lifetimes scale ∝ e^{c α^2} in the protected manifold; in practice, engineering
constraints linearize over the control window, giving an effective slope band 1.0–1.6 for θ vs α^2,
hence φ_cat ∈ [1.0, 1.6].

**Optomechanics.** Near fixed T, linewidth Γ ∝ Q^{-1}; coherence vs Q yields slopes in [0.8, 1.2] once
thermomechanical noise and readout backaction are included: φ_Q ∈ [0.8, 1.2].

**Rydberg arrays.** GHZ preparation fidelity vs atom number N in the blockade regime gives θ slopes 0.7–1.3
after removing finite-size and dephasing transients: φ_Ryd ∈ [0.7, 1.3].

**Conclusion.** These physics-grounded bands match those used in the statistical mapping. Widening by ×4
does not materially change δ_{lab→scale}, and M1 remains decisively preferred (see main Appendix F).
