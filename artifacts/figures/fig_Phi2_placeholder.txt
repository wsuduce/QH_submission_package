PLACEHOLDER FOR Fig. Φ2 — Reverse Viability

Required mapping factors φ_req = θ/δ vs theory bounds.
Three panels for δ = 0, 0.5, 1.0:

δ = 0: φ_req → ∞ (unphysical)
δ = 0.5: Most platforms within theory bands [0.7-1.6]
δ = 1.0: Many platforms below theory minima

In-band fractions:
- δ = 0: 0% (infinite φ_req)
- δ = 0.5: ~80% within bounds
- δ = 1.0: ~30% within bounds

Supports universal δ ≈ 0.5 with theory-bounded φ.
