FIGURE STUB: Fig. Φ4 — τ Posterior (Corner)


Corner plot showing hierarchical posterior density in (μ_δ, τ).
- Main panel: 2D hexbin density plot
- Marginal panels: 1D histograms for μ_δ and τ
- Key annotations: μ_δ = 0.502, τ₉₅ < 0.037
- Caption: "Hierarchical universality: posterior in (μ_δ, τ). 
  The 95% bound τ₉₅ < 0.037 indicates small inter-domain scatter."
