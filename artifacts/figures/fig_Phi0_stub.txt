FIGURE STUB: Fig. Φ0 — Raw θ (Null Test)


Boxplot showing raw platform protection exponents θ prior to mapping.
- X-axis: Platforms (NV, Si:P, Cat, Transmon, Optomech, Rydberg)
- Y-axis: Raw protection exponent θ  
- Box plots with median lines and jittered data points
- N annotations per platform
- Caption: "Raw platform protection exponents θ prior to any mapping. 
  The spread demonstrates platform dependence without physics-informed mapping."
