FIGURE STUB: Fig. Φ2 — Reverse Viability (φ_req vs theory bands)


Three-panel plot showing required φ_req = θ/δ for δ = 0, 0.5, 1.0.
- Scatter points: φ_req per platform with error bars
- Shaded bands: Theory-predicted φ windows per platform
- Annotations: In-band fraction per δ value
- Caption: "Reverse viability: required mapping factors φ_req compared to theory windows. 
  δ=0 and δ=1 broadly violate platform theory; δ≈0.5 lies largely within bands."
