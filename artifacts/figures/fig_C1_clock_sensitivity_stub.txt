FIGURE STUB: Fig. C1 — Clock Sensitivity k(z)


Two-panel plot showing k(z) evolution for different time coordinates.
- Top panel: k vs z for e-fold, conformal, H₀-lookback clocks
- Bottom panel: Residual trends (curvature metric)
- E-fold nearly flat; others show systematic k(z) drift
- Caption: "Time-coordinate test: only e-fold u=ln a sustains single k across 4≤z<8. 
  Other clocks exhibit pronounced k(z) curvature, breaking parameter-free mapping."
