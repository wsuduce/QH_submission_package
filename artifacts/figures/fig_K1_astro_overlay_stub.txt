FIGURE STUB: Fig. K1 — Astrophysics Overlay


Multi-series plot comparing g(z) evolution across models and data.
- MIDIS observational data (black points with error bars)
- SCF β/α→k prediction (green line, k=0.530)
- TNG100/EAGLE model series (mean/peak proxies)
- Acceptance rule box: Single k across proxies, within 1σ, no retuning
- Caption: "Matched-cuts comparison: data, SCF prediction, and simulation proxies. 
  Baseline models exhibit proxy-dependent slopes requiring retuning."
            

This is a placeholder for the actual figure that would be generated 
with the full data visualization pipeline.
