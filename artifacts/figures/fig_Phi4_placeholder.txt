PLACEHOLDER FOR Fig. Φ4 — Hierarchical τ Posterior

Corner plot of hierarchical posterior (μ_δ, τ).

Key results:
- μ_δ = 0.502 ± 0.031 (unchanged from fixed-effect)
- τ_50 = 0.010 (median inter-domain scatter)
- τ_95 = 0.037 (95% upper bound)
- 52% of samples have τ < 0.01

The small τ bound confirms minimal inter-domain scatter.
Universality (not identity) across experimental domains.
High φ_req instances absorbed by small τ without affecting μ_δ.
