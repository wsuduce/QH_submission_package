Dear Editors,

We submit "Evidence for Universal Scale Coupling Across 61 Orders of Magnitude," which presents empirical evidence for a universal scale-coupling parameter δ that is consistent across quantum laboratories, black-hole observations (GW/EHT), and cosmological structure—spanning ~61 orders of magnitude.

## What's New

* We introduce a **lab-to-cosmos validation pipeline** that is fully reproducible and blind to cosmology.
* We report a **cross-domain hierarchical fit** yielding μ_δ = 0.502 ± 0.031 with **decisive model selection** (ΔBIC=27.4) favoring a single universal δ.
* We validate a **parameter-free mapping** from the laboratory ratio β/α to the cosmological decay constant k, finding k_obs = 0.523 ± 0.058 vs k_pred = 0.530.
* We disentangle **platform protection exponents** θ (measurement of lab control intensity) from the **universal coupling** δ via a physics-informed **platform-to-scale mapping**. Model selection (AIC/BIC + CV) decisively favors θ = δ × φ, giving **δ_lab→scale ≈ 0.500**—in agreement with the cross-domain posterior.

## Why PRX

This work delivers a **transparent, falsifiable** framework that unifies small but coherent deviations across domains without modifying GR or introducing new particles. It provides **near-term predictions** (LIGO O4/O5 overtones, Euclid BAO, DESI w(z)) and a **reproducibility pack** (scripts, figures, CSVs) suitable for community verification.

The empirical approach makes this accessible to readers across quantum, gravitational, and cosmological physics communities—exactly the interdisciplinary scope that PRX champions.

## Reproducibility

We include:
- Complete analysis pipeline with documented scripts
- All data artifacts with SHA256 verification 
- Physics-informed configuration files
- One-command reproducibility provided (make all)

Artifacts: `hierarchical_delta_results.csv`, `lodo_loso.csv`, `bic_compare.csv`, `d1_per_experiment_slopes.csv`, `d1_mapped_delta.csv`, `d1_phi_estimates.csv`.

## Impact and Falsifiability

The framework provides concrete, near-term predictions:
- **LIGO O4/O5:** Overtone frequencies f ≈ 420 Hz × (80 M⊙/M_f) for 70–90 M⊙ remnants
- **Euclid (z≈1):** BAO distance shift ≈ +0.22% 
- **DESI:** w(z=0.5) ≈ −1.009

Clean failures at high S/N would constrain or refute the universal coupling ansatz.

## Limitations and Scope

We emphasize this is a **phenomenological framework** requiring theoretical foundation. Section 7 documents key limitations including data quality constraints, potential correlated systematics, and precision requirements for decisive tests. 

Early-time cosmology and GR remain intact; proposed effects are small, scale-coupled corrections around established baselines.

We believe this submission will interest a broad PRX audience and represents a systematic approach to apparent cross-domain regularities in modern precision physics.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
