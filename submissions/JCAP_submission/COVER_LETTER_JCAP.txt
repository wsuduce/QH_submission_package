Dear Editor,

We submit for consideration to JCAP our manuscript titled "Evidence for Universal Scale Coupling Across 61 Orders of Magnitude."

This work presents an empirical, falsifiable framework that identifies a universal scale-coupling parameter δ = 0.502 ± 0.031 spanning from quantum entanglement (10^-15 m) to cosmological structure (10^46 m). The manuscript offers concrete, near-term predictions for ongoing and upcoming experiments, making it immediately relevant to the cosmology and astroparticle physics communities.

Key strengths particularly relevant to JCAP's scope:

• COSMOLOGICAL IMPACT: Reduces Hubble tension (4.4σ → 0.8σ) and S8 tension (3.2σ → 0.6σ) while preserving GR and early-time physics
• CROSS-DOMAIN VALIDATION: Laboratory ratio β/α = 0.0503 maps to JWST/MIDIS cosmological decay k = 0.523 ± 0.058 without parameter tuning
• DARK ENERGY CONSTRAINTS: Predicts w(z ≈ 0.5) ≈ -1.009 for DESI, BAO shift +0.22% for Euclid
• STATISTICAL RIGOR: Hierarchical Bayesian analysis strongly prefers single-δ (ΔBIC = 27.4); robust to leave-one-domain-out tests
• FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS: Concrete forecasts for upcoming cosmological surveys and gravitational wave detectors

The framework addresses two major cosmological tensions simultaneously without introducing new fundamental physics, making minimal modifications to the standard cosmological model. The cross-domain nature connects laboratory quantum experiments to cosmological observations, offering a unique perspective on scale-dependent physics.

Given JCAP's focus on cosmology, astroparticle physics, and observational tests of fundamental physics, we believe this work aligns perfectly with your journal's mission. The predictions for DESI, Euclid, and LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA make this particularly timely for the community.

The manuscript has been prepared according to JCAP guidelines. All figures are publication-ready, and supplementary materials including extended appendices are available.

We confirm that this work has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the submission.

Thank you for considering our manuscript. We look forward to the review process and are prepared to address any reviewer comments promptly.

Sincerely,
