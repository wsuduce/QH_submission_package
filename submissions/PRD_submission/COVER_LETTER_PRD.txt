Dear Editor,

We submit for consideration to Physical Review D our manuscript titled "Evidence for Universal Scale Coupling Across 61 Orders of Magnitude."

This work presents an empirical, falsifiable framework that identifies a universal scale-coupling parameter δ = 0.502 ± 0.031 spanning from quantum entanglement (10^-15 m) to cosmological structure (10^46 m). The manuscript offers concrete, near-term predictions for ongoing and upcoming experiments, making it immediately relevant to the physics community.

Key strengths of this submission:

• FALSIFIABLE FRAMEWORK: Concrete, near-term predictions for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA O4-O5, Euclid BAO shifts, and DESI w(z) ≈ -1.009
• RIGOROUS STATISTICS: Hierarchical Bayesian analysis strongly prefers single-δ (ΔBIC = 27.4); robust to leave-one-domain-out tests (max shift 0.18σ)
• PARAMETER-FREE VALIDATION: Laboratory ratio β/α = 0.0503 maps to JWST/MIDIS cosmological decay k = 0.523 ± 0.058 without tuning
• TRANSPARENCY: Two domains constrain δ; two others (GW/EHT) are compatibility checks, not detections. Full reproducibility with open artifacts
• COSMOLOGICAL IMPACT: Reduces Hubble tension (4.4σ → 0.8σ) and S8 tension (3.2σ → 0.6σ) while preserving GR and early-time physics
• FULL REPRODUCIBILITY: All code and data publicly available (Zenodo DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17010399)

The manuscript carefully distinguishes between constraining domains (cosmology, lab-mapped quantum platforms) and compatibility checks (GW ringdown, EHT shadows), maintaining scientific rigor throughout. We provide extensive statistical validation including model selection, parameter provenance, and systematic uncertainty propagation.

Given PRD's scope in gravitation and cosmology, and the manuscript's implications for understanding scale-dependent physics across the universe, we believe this work will be of significant interest to your readership. The predictions for LIGO O4/O5 and upcoming cosmological surveys make this particularly timely.

The manuscript has been prepared according to PRD guidelines using REVTeX 4.2. All figures are publication-ready, and supplementary materials including extended appendices are available.

We confirm that this work has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the submission.

Thank you for considering our manuscript. We look forward to the review process and are prepared to address any reviewer comments promptly.

Sincerely,
